# Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the steps to develop the Jungian dream analyzer app using Cursor.

## Step 1: Set Up the Project
- Install dependencies: `npm install @chakra-ui/react` (or Tailwind CSS).

## Step 2: Implement Dream Input
- Create `DreamInput.tsx` with a text field and voice recording button.
- Use **Web Speech API** to transcribe voice input to text.
- Handle transcription errors gracefully.

## Step 3: Develop Dream Analysis Logic
- Write `dreamAnalysisService.ts` to process dream text and generate a Jungian analysis.
- Implement logic to identify symbols, archetypes, and collective unconscious themes.
- Example: Map common symbols (e.g., "flying" → freedom) and combine into a narrative.

## Step 4: Display the Analysis
- Create `AnalysisDisplay.tsx` to render the analysis in a readable format.
- Add buttons to save the analysis locally (e.g., to `localStorage` or as a downloadable file).

## Step 5: Integrate Local Saving
- Use `localStorage` to save analyses with timestamps.
- Provide an option to download the analysis as a text file.
- Ensure users can view past analyses saved in local storage.

## Step 6: Test and Debug
- Test all features: dream input (text and voice), analysis generation, and local saving.
- Use Cursor’s chat to troubleshoot errors by pasting code or logs.

## Step 7: Deploy the App
- Deploy on **Vercel** (`vercel --prod`).
- Ensure the app is accessible and functional in production.

## Timeline
- **Week 1:** Project setup and dream input implementation.
- **Week 2:** Dream analysis logic and display.
- **Week 3:** Local saving and testing.
- **Week 4:** Debugging and deployment.
